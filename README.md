### Project Details
This project is a Brazilian ecommerce website in which a user can interact with. An user can place orders for the product(s) that he or she may needs based off of the price, quality of products, and how likely they are to buy from them again. The information is stored in a dataset in which there are approximately 100,000 orders at multiple marketplaces that has taken place over the course of 2 years in Brazil. The dataset contains information regarding customers, sellers, products, reviews, and the location of both sellers and customers. We will use this data to find interesting relationships between the customer and sellers. These relationships can be anything from finding which products are selling better, how loyal customers are to sellers and how dependable sellers can be, whether good reviews correlate with sales and other kinds of fascinating facts that might help improve performance or inform customers.
